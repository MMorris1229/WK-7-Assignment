         But hey, at least I'm never short on high-fives or stinky socks to sniff.<br>
         I'm a superhero in disguise, a ninja with a loud whistle, and a rockstar with <br>
         a never-ending supply of Goldfish crackers. My boys may have me running on <br>
         coffee and prayers, but they've also filled my heart with more love than I ever<br>
         thought possible. So here's to me, the proud and slightly sleep-deprived <br>
         mama bear of three amazing boys! May they one day realize just how lucky <br>
         they are to have a mom who's always there with a hug, a laugh, <br>
         and a never-ending supply of patience.</font></p>

         <h2>My New Journey Began When I Signed Up for a Frontend Coding Bootcamp!</h2>


         <p> <font size="+2"> You're probably wondering how I traded in my dull steal toed boots for a swanky<br>
         coding keyboard and made the leap to a more fulfilling career...Well, it all started <br>
         with a spark of inspiration and a dash of self-improvement. I enrolled in a <br>
         Frontend coding bootcamp back in November, and let me tell you, some weeks have been<br>
         a rollercoaster ride of excitement and frustration, but I'm still here and coding away!<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
         I've always had a passion for making things look pretty, ever since I was a teenager perfecting<br>
         my Myspace page and making all my friends jealous. But now, I get to channel that creative <br>
         energy into coding and making things look even better!<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
         With 11 weeks left in the program, I'm determined to make the most of this opportunity and continue<br>
         learning and growing as a coder. Check out the links below to see some of my beginner-level <br>
         projects and watch as I turn my coding dreams into a reality!"</font></p>

         &nbsp;&nbsp;
         <P><font size="+2">Week 5 was the first project I got to create an interactive menu in JS.<br>
            Talk about a struggle, but overall I really enojyed learning how to do this!</font></P>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <P><font size="+2">Week 6 I created a War Card Game. This assignment almost cost me my<br>
        coding dreams...I was ready to give up, my code wasn't perfect but I some how got<br>
        the game to post to the console. It was a win in my book. I definitely plan to revisit <br>
        this code to try and perfect it. </font></P>
